How climate-change derailed my life

I was born in Paris in 1990, in a small flat next to Les Batignolles in the 17th arrondissement, from a "Breton" and an "Alsacienne" who met in Los Angeles.
My sister was born a year later, and about another year after that our dad decided to quit working for Shell in La Défense, said he felt like an "ant". 
So we moved to the South of France (Nîmes) where we started kindgergarden, enjoyed the parks and even had a swimming-pool in our residence.
3 years later our dad got a job in Gemenos and we moved into a beautiful house in Ceyreste in Provence by the Mediterranean sea.
There, me and my sister studied all the way to high school. I remember we were so close to the sea that sailing was an option in our PE class.
Our dad made a very good living, he built a pool in the garden, bought a small motor boat, and we spent 15 years of our lives in one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen, sailing, enjoying sunny weather almost all year long in the middle of olive-tree plantations.

While our Mom took care of us at home, she still got various jobs in real estate, sales, fashion over the years to keep busy and retain some independance. She used to work a great job in tourism which was basically the equivalent of being an influencer today, without the fans: she would be sent abroad to test hotels, hikes and activities to compile pre-organised trips that she would then sell in Paris. She travelled mostly in the US and loved her job but had to quit when she had me and my sister.
Dad travelled a lot for work, was a very serious man (who probably got pressured a lot at work), and put quite a bit of pressure on us at school. Anytime our results wouldn't be satisfying he would pay  for home-teachers to help us catch-up. We were very privileged.

Given this context, we could only do very well in high-school and were oriented towards "classes préparatoires" in Marseille and I attended a business school in Toulouse, where I joined what they call the "junior consulting company", spent a gap year in China learning Mandarin, and graduated with a masters in corporate and market finance.
My internships revolved around international project management (Peking, Qingdao), wealth management (Aix-en-Provence) and mergers and acquisitions (Paris).
At the end of my masters I attended a teacherless coding school based on peer-to-peer in Paris, even got to spend a semester in Palo Alto and San Francisco. My goal was to become specialised in Sino-European private equity with a deep understanding of tech, or simply put: I wanted to pursue the most elitist job within reach and to make a lot of money.
After 3 years working in finance between Paris and China (Shanghai & Hong-Kong), I was 28 years old, great career opportunities laid ahead, I was making great money, travelling often and meeting friends all over. I was starting to "live the life".

Still mostly very unaware of how privileged I had been, when unexpectedly climate change made its way into my life.
