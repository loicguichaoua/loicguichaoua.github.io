70 billion. That's the number of animals killed for food in the world each year.

<br>
Here's everything you need (or rather want) to know about what we do to animals.

<h5>Thought-provoking documentaries 🧠</h5>
From easy to watch (😁) all the way up to the unfiltered truth (😰):

This short documentary relates the testimony of Dr. Frances Cheng, Dr Emily Trunnell and Dr Emily Clippinger who all came to realise through their research on animals that animal testing is a habit from the past that has become irrelevant when trying to improve the human condition.
- <a href="https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/098858-000-A/climat-mon-cerveau-fait-l-autruche/" target="_blank">Climat : mon cerveau fait l'autruche (2021, 52min, FR)</a> 😁😁😁  
A very interesting documentary about why we are able to both understand how cruel the current system is and yet keep paying to make that very cruelty happen.

<h5>The toughest documentaries (to get it over with quickly) 😨</h5>  
- <a href="https://youtu.be/LQRAfJyEsko" target="_blank">Dominion (2018, 2h, EN)</a> 😰😰😰  
Plain. Unfiltered. Truth. I found it extremely hard to watch but deeply moving.
- <a href="https://youtu.be/8gqwpfEcBjI" target="_blank">Earthlings (2005, 1h35, EN)</a> 😰😰😰  
Very similar to the above. Ready your tissues.
- <a href="https://youtu.be/Trge8blO_hI" target="_blank">The Damned: Stories of Slaughterhouse Workers (2017, 37min, FR)</a> 😰😰😰  
A too often overlooked aspect of animal products' consumption: someone had to take the animal and transform it into steaks. And doing this hundreds of times a day isn't good for you. This workforce is extremely precarious and often has no other choice than to accept (and keep) this type of job.

<h5>Really good books 📖</h5>  
- <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-diet/" target="_blank">How Not To Diet</a>, by Dr. Michael Greger.  
A doctor who spent years building a team whose goal is simple: to read as many scientific studies about the human diet every year and to sum it all up in one book which is updated regularly. Unsurprisingly: you should go vegan asap.  
- <a href="https://earthlinged.org/orderbook" target="_blank">This Is Vegan Propaganda</a>, by Earthling Ed.  
Probably one of the most respected global speaker about veganism. He used to love meat and is now one of veganism's top global advocates.  
- <a href="https://book.nomeatathlete.com/" target="_blank">The Plant-Based Athlete</a>, by Matt Frazier and Robert Cheeke.  
Witness how the world's best athletes are massively switching to a 100% plant-based diet as it has become undeniable that it helps them perform even better. I love how they include dozens of "what I eat in a day" testimonies from gold medals and super-athletes, those are filled with great tips to implement in your daily routine.
